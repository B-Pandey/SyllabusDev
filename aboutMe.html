                <p> I was born in a beautiful country Nepal. I migrated to USA with my family. I have been living in Virginia since 2010. I finished high school diploma in my back home. I graduated from Northern Virginia Community College in 2018.  My educational aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. This is my second semester at GMU. I’m a graphic designer with over 8 years of experience specializing in creating beautiful layouts such as posters, book covers, and banners. I am looking forward to growing my web development and programming skills. </p>
